<h2>CertMentor sessions</h2>
<hr>
<p class="index-boxp">
CertMentor sessions are something that happen every week and within these sessions,the mentors discuss about upcoming events,tests and anything else that is related with first year students.In the previous week the mentors discussed about how to approach the programming test which is coming up that following week.They showed us ways we can write our code and even interacted with us to ask us which ways we would also do it.The sessions are really good as they keep us updated on what happens each week as well as asking them any questions that we need to ask.The mentors are really kind and friendly as well as being very supportive if needed.The mentors can help us if we're struggling with any of work, as they have been through the same things we're as first year students are going through now.They all come from different backgrounds of computing which is really good because it'd be nice to have different view points from each mentor to see what's like in that course/work place.The mentors are very clear with what they say and very understandable, this is a really good way of knowing your surroundings at Universty.Below shows an image of one the sessions where one of the mentors were showing us how to tackle one of the questions of the practice test for programming.
