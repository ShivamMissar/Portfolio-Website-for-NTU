<h2>Python Workshops</h2>
<hr>
<p class="index-boxp"> .So I had the chance to attend two of the python basics workshops.In the first workshop 1.0 and the presenter was going through the most common things in python such as for loops, if,elif and else statements and branching.The presenter made the session very interactive with the students and the students had asked loads of questions if they didn't understand anything.There were loads of challenges set by the presenter so that students could try practice the code themselves.However, in workshop 2.0 there was more python learning so, in this workshop the presenter was different as well as going through different things such as dictionaires as seen in a picture taken by me as well as other things such as while loops, lists,tuples and many other python basics.This was a really good expereince for me as I was struggling in python before and by attending this, it has helped me develop my python a bit more than before and also helped me understand my problems that I was facing before.
