  <h2>About me</h2>
  <hr>
  <p class="index-boxp">
    My name is Shivam Missar, I am a first year student,  studying software engineering.I thought I'd chose this course because I'm really intrested in coding and how it applies to real life stuff.My main intreset in software engineering is web Development/web design I really like these topics because there is so much to do with it and some much to learn.I'm a really hard working student, I like to do tasks, I like to be kept busy.I believe by working hard, the end result is satisfying.I'm very optiumistic I like to try out new things.I had no background/history for coding but yet I decided to choose to take this course as it sounded like a skill I need but as well as having an  intrest for computers.So yeah thats me.
