        <h2>So what is CPD?</h2>
          <hr>
          <p class="index-boxp">CPD stands for Continuing Personal/Proffesional Development.CPD acts like a personal tracker.So with the CPD forum, you first need to set yourself a goal of what you want to do, then the next set is  what you will you do by setting yourself this goal.For example, I want to get some support with my references so what do I need to do in order to achieve that goal is to  book an appointment with the libary team for help.After setting yourself a goal you can set yourself a deadline of when you want to achieve this by!The next stage would be to show the date(s) you have attended, to prove that you actually went and also to remind yourself when you had gone.The next stage and a very important stage would be the reflection stage.This  is where you write out what you have understood or what have you done for that speific activity.Below shows an empty CPD forum to show how one would look.</p>
